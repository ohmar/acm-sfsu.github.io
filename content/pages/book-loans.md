San Francisco State ACM has its own library full of donated books from previous semesters. Need a textbook? We have textbooks for computer science, ath, and physics courses. We let you borrow books for a semester instead of purchasing one at your expense. This FREE service is for members only. 

Not a member? No problem -- it's cheaper to [join our ACM chapter](join.html) than to buy a single textbook.

**How to check out a book:**

1. Check the book list below, or posted on the back cabinet of the Undergraduate Computer Science Lab. This list shows every book we have.
2. Find the book you would like to borrow from this list.
3. E-mail the [ACM at SFSU](mailto: acm.sfsu@gmail.com) to arrange a check out session.
4. Come to check out session.
5. Read and Sign [Library Lending Agreement](http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=ddwck7wd_42ddgv6zgk)
6. Take book home and put it to good use.

**How to donate a book:**

We need your used textbooks! We are currently accepting textbooks for computer science, math, engineering, and physics courses. To donate a textbook, you can email the [ACM at SFSU](mailto: acm.sfsu@gmail.com) or drop your book off in the CS dept. office (TH-906.)

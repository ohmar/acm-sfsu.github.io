Authors: Tom Spalding, Bill Hsu
Summary: Friday, April 11th 3pm - 5pm, Dr. Hsu will be leading a presentation on Processing in TH 329. Start programming graphics and animation with Processing ([processing.org](http://www.processing.org)), an easy-to-learn, free, open-source programming environment. Processing is great for beginners who are learning to program, and powerful enough for professionals to use as a design tool. 

Start programming graphics and animation with Processing ([processing.org](http://www.processing.org)), an easy-to-learn, free, open-source programming environment. Processing is great for beginners who are learning to program, and powerful enough for professionals to use as a design tool. 

Processing is based on Java. It is trivial to export your Processing work into a Java applet or application. People can view your work easily through a web browser, on multiple platforms, without having the Processing environment.

We'll go over the basics of programming and graphics, working with color, geometric shapes and images, and controlling animation and movement. We'll play with a lot of examples and learn to customize and extend them, so bring a computer (Linux, Mac OSX and Windows are all supported), preferably with Java loaded. If you haven't done much programming before, and/or need help setting up the Processing environment, it might be a good idea to come on time.

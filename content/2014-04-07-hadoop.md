Wednesday, April 9th 5-6pm we're having a Hadoop Workshop in TH 331. Arthur Vigil will be going over a general [MapReduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) approach used to process and distribute large data sets, as well as an introduction to using [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org) for data analytics.

Please download the [VM](http://www.cloudera.com/content/support/en/downloads/download-components/download-products.html?productID=F6mO278Rvo&version=2) that will be used for demonstration purposes. It would be good if people get this installed before coming, it is quite large. I would suggest downloading the Virtualbox image (and setup [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)) but vmware player would work too.

I have also put a copy in zip format (easier to deal with on OS X) on [thecity](http://thecity.sfsu.edu/~ahvigil/hadoop/cloudera_vm.zip).

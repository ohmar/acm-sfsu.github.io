Hi Everyone! Today at 3PM in TH 329 we're having our first website hackathon! Come out and socially code with us!  For everyone, whether a beginner or an elite coder, we want to push around code and get input from you!

Our page utilizes [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com), a static site generator powered by Python. I previously [wrote a bit](http://sfsu.acm.org/blogging-about-blogs.html) about setting up our blog. You can find all our code on [our Github](https://github.com/acm-sfsu).

Have a great break! When we get back there's a Career Expo on Friday April 4th, and later that day we're having another Android Workshop! Our [last one](http://sfsu.acm.org/intro-to-android-mobile-app-development-friday-221-3pm-th-335.html) went great! See our [calendar of events](http://sfsu.acm.org/pages/calendar.html).
